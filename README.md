Hypothesis:

We are planning on seeing if there is a correlation between Trump tweets and financial markets, specifically cryptocurrencies and stock market indexes. We plan on doing this by running a VADER analysis on tweets(@realDonaldTrump), noting frequency, popularity and comparing it to the changing prices of Cryptocurrency(Bitcoin). This involves using a existing dataset on Bitcoin from www.kaggle.com as well creating our own dataset by calling the tweepy API. We will then plot our findings, determine trends, and report findings. 

Research Questions to Answer:

What is the relationship between Trump tweets and the price of Bitcoin?

What is the relationship between Trump tweets and the stock market as a whole?

How has Trump's candidacy and election to office affected his influence over the market?

How has the Twitter account's relative popularity and the popularity of each tweet affected his influence?
