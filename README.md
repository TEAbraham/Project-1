Hypothesis:
We are planning on seeing if there is a correlation between Trump tweets and financial markets, specifically cryptocurrencies and stock market indexes. We plan on doing this by running a VADER analysis on tweets(@realDonaldTrump), noting frequency, popularity and comparing it to the changing prices of Cryptocurrency(Bitcoin). This involves using a existing dataset on Bitcoin from www.kaggle.com as well creating our own dataset by calling the tweepy API. We will then plot our findings, determine trends, and report findings.
